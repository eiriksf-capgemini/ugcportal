/**
 * The single ownership gate for the per-item media routes (ugcportal-bdh).
 * Mirrors requireAdmin in src/lib/admin.ts: it answers "may this caller
 * touch this row", and leaves building the response to the route.
 *
 * On success it also hands back the row, because both callers need it —
 * PATCH to echo the updated record, DELETE to know which object to remove
 * from storage — so the gate costs one read rather than two.
 *
 * This read is *not* the authoritative check on its own: it is separated
 * from the write that follows by a round trip, so every caller must also
 * scope its write by `{ id, userId }` (see the routes). What this gate buys
 * is the right status code and an early exit before any write is attempted.
 *
 * 403-vs-404: a caller who owns nothing here learns that the id exists.
 * That is a deliberate, narrow trade. Media ids are cuids — not enumerable,
 * so an attacker can't sweep the table for valid ones — and answering 404
 * for "exists but isn't yours" makes every real authorization bug look like
 * a typo to whoever is debugging it. Admin/moderation routes make the other
 * choice (see requireAdmin) because there the existence of the route itself
 * is the secret; here it isn't.
